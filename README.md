# Hangman-ASCII
The classical Hangman implemented in python3 from scratch

Words.txt contains the English words that are used for the game.

Basic Rules of Hangman:
1) You have 5 lives.
2) You are given the length of an unknown word. You have to guess an alphabet that could be a part of the word.
3) If that letter does not occur even once in the word then you lose a life. Else it is revealed where that alphabet occurs in the word.
4) continue steps 2,3 until there are no unknown characters left or you have lost all lives.

There are thousands of codes that are better,faster and more efficient than this one.

I only created this mini game in python3 to just become familiar with the langauge
